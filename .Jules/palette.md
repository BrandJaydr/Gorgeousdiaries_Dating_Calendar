## 2026-02-28 - [Accessible Icon-Only Buttons]
**Learning:** Icon-only buttons without ARIA labels are a common accessibility pattern in many apps that use icon libraries like Lucide. Adding dynamic ARIA labels (e.g., "Open menu" vs "Close menu") significantly improves the experience for screen reader users.
**Action:** Always check icon-only buttons for missing ARIA labels and title attributes for hover tooltips.
